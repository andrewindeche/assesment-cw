## Changes Made

###[Component Name]

1. useEffect in line 37
   - Issue: useEffect missing dependencies causing stale state
   - Fix: Added required dependencies to useEffect array
2. Accessibility issue with the search icon line 98
   - Issue: search icon is not accessible
   - Fix: Added search icon to the input field

### [App.tsx] [SearchBar.tsx] [HeroSection.tsx]

1. All Functions in App.tsx page.
   Header (line 79) moved to layout/Header.tsx
   App (line 111) retained as is
   BoxArea108 (line 45) converted to features/SearchBar
   BoxArea97 (line 26) converted to layout/HeroSection
   TagList (line 8) converted to features/TagList

   - Issue: Monolithic page structure with multiple responsibilities
   - Fix: Modularized and separated concerns of structure into reusable feature based components

### [SearchBar.tsx]  [HeroSection.tsx]

2. Component naming — HeroSection (line 3) and SearchBar (line 7)
   - Issue: Non-descriptive naming conventions reduce readability
   - Fix: Renamed components using clearer, more descriptive names

3. SearchBar behavior — lines 15–16
- Issue: useEffect syncs the initial value repeatedly, which can lead to unnecessary re-renders and     excessive API calls
- Fix: Implemented a debounce mechanism and abstracted search logic into a useDebouncedSearch hook

### [package.json] [package-lock.json] 

4. Code formatting
- Issue: Inconsistent spacing and formatting across the codebase
- Fix: Applied consistent formatting using Prettier

### [App.tsx] [TagList.tsx]
5. App.tsx — line 7
- Issue: Unused state setTags caused inconsistency with linting rules
- Fix: Removed the unused state

6. TagListProps — line 3
- Issue: Tags were hardcoded, not reusable; TagList required prop-based data from App.tsx
- Fix: Fix: Added a TagListProps interface and passed tag data as props 

### [TagList.tsx]
7. Line 14 and 16
- Issue: No unique index for tags, which could cause issues when similar tag names exist
- Fix: Added a unique index for each tag in the render loop

### [TagList.tsx] [Searchbar.tsx] [Header.tsx]
8. Accessibility audit — TagList.tsx (line 19), SearchBar.tsx (line 26), Header.tsx (lines 25 and 7),   HeroSection.tsx (line 5)
- Issue: Interactive elements like tags and inputs lacked accessibility features
- Fix: Added aria-label attributes and replaced generic <div> tags with semantic HTML where applicable

### [Header.tsx]
9. Line 14 and 29
- Issue: Inconsistent use of inline styles for styling elements
- Fix: Replaced inline styles with Tailwind CSS classes for consistent and maintainable styling

10. Line 10
- Issue: Incorrect word used ("Worptionary" instead of "Worctionary")
- Fix: Replaced "Worptionary" with the correct spelling, "Worctionary"

11. Line 8,9,10
- Issue: Font size and spacing do not match the image's typography
- Fix: Updated the image dimensions to w-4 h-4, set the font size to text-md, and applied font-bold for the correct font weight

12. Line 7
- Issue: Padding of the page does not match the image’s padding style
- Fix: Adjusted padding to px-9 for consistency with the image's style

13. Line 26
- Issue: SearchBar is fully rounded, which does not match the image’s rounded style
- Fix: Adjusted the border radius to rounded-md for a more rectangular appearance
